            title: R autocompletion documentation - generation instructions
            intro: Before using R-autocompletion feature in Concerto, you need to make sure that R documentation based on R configuration in your system has been generated.
            info:
                directory: >
                    In order to generate this documentation, you need to open a console application (on Windows systems - `cmd`, on Linux `xterm`, `konsole` or `gnome-terminal`) and, inside it navigate into your Concerto installation directory:
                console: From that location, you will be able to use Symfony console. You will need to exacute `concerto:r:cache` operation with it
                console.more: click here for more information about Symfony console
                output: Running this command will display all R functions which were found in your system, and will prepare needed documentation files. Reload or reopen Concerto page in order to start using it when editing R sources.
